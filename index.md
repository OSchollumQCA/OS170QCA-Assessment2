This project is related to mine because of its interaction with humans. Being able to count the reps when you're working out can be a challenge. Therefore I'm wanting to make working out easier for people, by creating a similar project. The code for this project could be something i look into further.

This project is related to mine because as i said above, it's around the same area that i want to explore. I enjoed looking through this project, simply to see a different way of connecting someones movement and how many reps they completed. Researching further into this will help with stimulating ideas.

This project is related to mine because it's a Hamster running tracker. This is very similar to ideas I have, just for humans instead. I thought it was an interesting project, that i could gain some basic knowledge and skills from. 

## Other research ##

Within my research I've come across another project called *Personal Gym Timer*. The gym timer tracks you workout rep time, rest time and number of sets and when the time elapses, it alerts ther user visually and audibly. I really liked how this project encourages you to get the maximum results whenever your at the gym. 

I gathered information about how the project was made and how it works. When the timer is turned on, it operates in two basic modes, Auto mode and Set mode. This could be something i explore further to include in my own project design. When the auto mode is on, the user just needs to press the Green push button and start their workout. In this project, it will count up 60 seconds for the workout and down 30 seconds for rest time. This will then increase the number of sets (large red SSD) by one (new number of sets is 2) and count up 60 seconds then count down 30 seconds for rest. The workout time and rest time are also adjustable. 

Overall this project is extremely user friendly and simple to use. You can see the creater has thought about how the Timer would work for people who are visually impaired or have hearing difficulties, because the Timer alerts the user visually and audibly. Also, having the an adjustable workout and rest time is important for the flexablity of users. Below are images of the project and link to show how it works.

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
*Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence.*

### Design concept 1 ###
The concept for this design was to create a yoga mat into an at home workout tool. The idea is to create a bop it experience when working out. Sensor will be attached to the bottom of the yoga mat to send signals to the mirco bit that the particualr exercise is completed, therefore another exercise will be called out and the user will complete the next.

For example, the mat will indicate to the user to complete a 30sec plank. When the user completes this task, the mat will continue into the next. The longer you continue completing all the challenges the better your overall workout will be.

These two images show examples of how the yoga mat would look and how it'd be used. The white tapped crosses show where the sensors would be placed underneath the yoga mat.

The images above shows my thought process and sketches of how I wanted the mat to look. 

### Design concept 2 ###
My second concept was based around the use of a rugby ball. Something I thought would be useful for training purposes would be to create a rugby ball that measures the height, distance and velocity of the ball. This idea could be extremely useful for training purposes, whilst also keeping it entertaining. In order for this to work, I would need to come up with a way to connect the mirco bit to the rugby ball whilst also making sure that wherever this is placed, needs to be somewhere the user wont kick.

### Final design concept ###

My final concept is an adaptable fitness tracker. This fitness tracker will be able to count your reps with whatever exercise you are doing. Keeping track of your reps is something many people struggle with. Being able to not worry about counting and being able to complete your workout efficiently. The tracker can be used at home or in a gym environment, even used for coaching. The meaning behind it being adaptable is the fact that it can be used for several different workouts because you can adapt it to your shoe, wrist or head. If the fitness tracker is placed on a shoe, it's to count how many steps the user has made. If you're wanting to track your arm workouts, then you can attach it anywhere on your arm. For pushups or planks you're able to attach the fitness tracker to your head. For all of these, the fitness tracker comes with adjustable straps that will allow the user to workout with it.

This fitness tracker is interactive in the way the user uses it. The interaction of doing a particular workout is one of its major interactions. As well as the user being able to read how many reps they have completed. The tracker will be able to be turned off and on to save battery life. 

In order to create this, I'll need a way to connect the mirco bit to a band that's adjustable for the use of different interactions. Some sought of attachable velcro could be a could choice to attach the fitness tracker to the users body. The code for this project is most important for this to be able to function in the best way. 

Images below will show my sketches and rough ideas of how the fitness tracker will look.

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*Technical Development & Fabrication*

Part 1 - Developing a simple footstep tracker:

![Image](ScreenShot2020-04-22at10.46.57am.png)

*To start with the building of code, I needed a variable to store my number of steps. And then I needed the number of steps to be triggered by something. I added on shake to detect the step. In order for to always be able to see how many steps were counted I used a forever loop and added a show number to display the value of steps.*

![Image](IMG_0489.JPG)                        

![Image](IMG_7958.JPG)

*Images above show the number of steps when the mirco bit is shaken. When I did this, I noticed a delay in the display of steps. My next step will be to fix this problem with code* 

Part 2 - Developing a simple footstep tracker:

![Image](ScreenShot2020-04-22at11.17.31am.png)

*In order to get rid of the deplay in the display, I've used stop animation after changing the value of steps. This worked really effectively*

![Image](IMG_6324.JPG)

Part 3 - Physical Models for footstep tracker:

*Images above show a rough physical model of how I would want my fitness tracker to look. For this I've used all the code above as well. This is just a rough idea of how I want it to look, but I'll need to find an easy way to transfering it from a step tracker to an overall fitness tracker.*

Part 4 - Developing wrist tracker:

![Image](ScreenShot2020-04-22at12.04.21pm.png)

*As shown above, I've used the basic code that I used for the footstep tracker but instead using shake, I replaced it with on log up. For arm workouts you usually use weights which you lift up and down, therefore changing the code is very important for it to work properly.*

![Image](IMG_1836.JPG)

![Image](IMG_6896.JPG)

*The first image of myself holding the mircobit shows the step before lifting the weight upwards, to replicate an arm workout. Second image shows once the interaction is completed, as you can see the number has gone up because I've imitated doing an arm workout.*

Part 5 - Physical Model of arm workout tracker:

*Tap on the link to see it in action*

*The images above show my experimentation of my arm workout tracker. The first image is before the interaction of moving the arm up and then second image of the arm upwards. As you can see from the first and second image the amount of reps has gone up by 1. The same code was used to work this aswell.*

Part 6 - Developing push up tracker:

![Image](ScreenShot2020-04-22at1.16.26pm.png)

*For this i experiemented with different inputs, changing the way of how the movement will be counted. Overall the best one would be the log up variable which is used for arm workouts as well.*


## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
